## Challenges faced
One of the biggest challenges I faced was correctly implementing the new features while maintaining and making sure there was no contradictory logic in my existing code. I also had trouble debugging my code and learning from my mistakes. For example, when adding the add tasks and view tasks page page I ran into issues with Python's and HTML's indentation rules, which led to a syntax error. By carefully reviewing the code, understanding the error messages, and using AI for guidance, I was able to correctly format the code and get the features working as intended. This experience taught me the importance of attention to detail and error message debugging.
